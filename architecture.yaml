Key differences:

- Every label is in quotes: `S["Streamlit app: UI and backend"]`
- No `<br/>` tags
- No raw parentheses without quotes
- `subgraph` lines use: `subgraph ID ["Label text"]`

## 2. Preview again

With `architecture.md` open:

- Press `Cmd + Shift + V` to open the Markdown preview  
  or  
- Right-click → **Open Preview to the Side**

You should now see the architecture diagram rendered instead of the parse error. From there you can zoom and take a screenshot for your Day 1 post.

If it still breaks, send me the exact content of `architecture.md` (copy-paste) and I will adjust it to the strictest possible syntax so that your extension is happy.
